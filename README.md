<hr>

## Task: 7
-- Same as Task 3 just show an AntD <Alert /> with the error message at the top of the screen when fetch fails (rejected).
<hr>

## Task: 8
-- Same as Task 4 just implemented Sync the selectedKeys of the AntD Menu with the current URL path so the correct menu item stays highlighted on refresh & Created a uiSlice in Redux to store a collapsed boolean. Toggle this state when the user clicks a button, causing the Sider to expand or shrink globally across all pages.
